### What you planned to do
- Get the Side Panel to look cleaner
- Add new chat button functionality
- Fix issues when making the window smaller (website resizing issues).

### What you did not do
- I was not able to connect the chat buttons to conversation tokens. I realized it was more of
  a backend issue (was later resolved).
- Still have some resizing issues to fix on some pages. 

### What problems you encountered
- Making sure the screen kept the same size for all pages

### Issues you worked on
- [#58](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/58) Functionality for New Chat Button 
- [#67](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/58) Completing Panel / Setting up Conversation/Chat buttons 

### Files you worked on
 - index.html
 - main.css
 - index.css
 

### What I accomplished
I was able to make the panel look cleaner and add the Conversation buttons and their functionality.
I got the resizing for some of the pages to work, but some of the others one were still having issues so I will fix
that in the upcoming sprint.
