### What you planned to do
Create a dictionary in which I use the clinical doctors api that we have chosen in order to cleanly call upon and retrieve data. I also intend to 
help with integrating the api calls with gpt model. Reorganize files in ML folder.


### What you did not do
I did not get to help integrating with the gpt model. 

### What problems you encountered
There was a lack of communication between us to put it simply.
