### What you planned to do
Connect the front and back end.

### What you did not do
Connect the back end to the model. (It was handled by someone else though)

### What problems you encountered
I needed to familiarize myself with the django templating system. 
The switch to using django as the dyanamic file server threw off the front end team a bit.
