# Sprint 3
- Name: Jordan Huff
- Github: jordantrh
- Group: Baymax

### What you planned to do
- [Create Binary Classification Dataset](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/78)
- [Write Code to Separate Dataset into TensorFlow Format](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/79)
- [Develop Text Classification Model](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/80)
- [Finish Training Updated LLM](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/81)

### What you did not do
- I wanted to be able to finish the updated LLM, but the training was killed by a computer crash
- I wanted to expand the classification model so that it would be able to predict many different classifications at a time, but the development process took longer than expected

### What problems you encountered
- The LLM model that I had been training unfortunately lost all of its progress when the computer I was running the training on crashed with only ~30 hours left of the ~250 total
- I ran into some issues developing the text classification model and making sure the data that I used was representative enough of what a user would ask the LLM model

### Issues you worked on
- [Create Binary Classification Dataset](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/78)
- [Write Code to Separate Dataset into TensorFlow Format](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/79)
- [Develop Text Classification Model](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/80)
- [Finish Training Updated LLM](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/81)

### Files you worked on
- medical_text_classification.ipynb
- response_sort.ipynb

### What you accomplished
- We now have the start of a text classification dataset
- We now have a way to convert a raw dataset into the format that is required for TensorFlow models
- We now have a text classification model that is able to perform initial test classification very accurately
- Although the LLM failed to train, we do have an alternative solution of using OpenAI API calls
