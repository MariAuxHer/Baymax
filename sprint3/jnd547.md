# Sprint 3

Name: Jonathan Tran, GitHub ID: Elite Jono, Group: Baymax

## What I planned to do

- [Issue #88: Add another html page that allows the user to directly ask for information about specific doctors (without interacting with the ML model)](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/88)
- [Issue #89: allow the user to change profile information](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/89)
- [Issue #90: Post](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/90)
- [Issue #91: input error checking and various error messages](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/91)

## What I did not do

- I was able to do some input error checking and messages, but not for everything.
- I did not get to the html page about specific doctors

## What Problems I encountered

- I ran into a lot of trouble with put requests, account permissions, and response contents. However, Steven and I ironed those out.

## Issues I worked on

- [Issue #89: allow the user to change profile information](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/89)
- [Issue #90: Post](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/90)
- [Issue #91: input error checking and various error messages](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/91)

## What I accomplished

I made a good amount of progress this sprint. I was able to complete the change profile information process despite the various problems
along the way. The user can view their profile info and request to change the fields as needed. Some input checking and error messages were also
implemented. I have a check for emails, but it may need more testing. I also changed the state field to be a dropdown select, where users can
select any of the 50 states (in alphabetical order).
