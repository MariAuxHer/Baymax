        <p class="right">Hello, it's me</p>
        <p class="left">I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet</p>
        <p class="left">To go over everything</p>
        <p class="right">They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing</p>
        <p class="left">Hello, can you hear me?</p>
        <p class="right">I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be</p>
        <p class="left">When we were younger and free</p>
        <p class="right">I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet</p>
        <p class="right">There's such a difference between us</p>
        <p class="left">And a million miles</p>
        <p class="right">Hello from the other side</p>
        <p class="right">I must've called a thousand times</p>
        <p class="left">To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done</p>
        <p class="left">But when I call, you never seem to be home</p>
        <p class="left">Hello from the outside</p>
        <p class="right">At least, I can say that I've tried</p>
        <p class="left">To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart</p>
        <p class="right">But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore</p>
        <p class="left">Hello, how are you?</p>
        <p class="right">It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry</p>
        <p class="left">I hope that you're well</p>
        <p class="right">Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?</p>
