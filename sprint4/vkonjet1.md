### What you planned to do
My goal is to create the search page in which users can search up doctors by a level of organization (name, city, specialty, etc)


### What you did not do
I did not get to the point of connecting the backend to the front end, they exist but do not communicate, I also set up the back end a little bit but I can't truly test it because
I have no clue how docker is set up on this project and I don't want to accidently ruin the entire process.

### What problems you encountered
It was mainly the issue of getting CSS and HTML to work together
