# Hello Plus

## What does it do?

This basic program generates a random number between 0 and 9 and the user is
expected to enter a number into the text box. The user submits their answer
and if the answer and the random number match, the user wins.

## How to Run

After downloading all three files, the user can go [here](http://127.0.0.1:5500/helloplus.html)
to launch the program. The random number is generated upon the window loading. The user submits
their answer by pressing the submit button.

## How this Tech is Useful

This is my first time touching anything front end related, so it was a learning experience for me.
Getting a decent grip on the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will help me contribute to the front end
part of the project and it will hopefully make it easier to learn some frameworks.
