# Sprint 1

Name: Amal Sam, GitHub ID: amals610, Group: Baymax

## What I planned to do

- [Issue #24: Create About Page](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/24)
- [Issue #25: Structuring About Page](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/25)
- [Issue #26: Connect About page with other UI pages](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/26)
- [Issue #27: Complete About page with everyone's images and credentials](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/27)

## What I did not do

- I looked into making the UI Pages a littler more professional and cleaner and also into fetching and sending request to the backend.
  I have yet to implement this.

## What Problems I encountered

- I didn't encounter too many issues with the project itself to be honest. I think the real struggles were communicating tasks and objectives
  with the other members of the frontend team and also being stuck with work from other classes.

## What I accomplished

So for this Sprint I was able to create a page to showcase all the developers on this page. I also did some debugging for my peer's pages. Front_end work is still new to me, but I am finding it pretty fun. I only need some images for the about page and buttons redirecting it back to the main page. Overall I think we made good progress for the first sprint. In the upcoming weeks my peers and I will do more research on the various ways to fetch and request so that we can implement that into the front_end of our project.
