# Sprint 1

Name: Amal Sam, GitHub ID: amals610, Group: Baymax

## What I planned to do

- [Issue #24: Create About Page](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/24)
- [Issue #25: Structuring About Page](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/25)
- [Issue #26: Connect About page with other UI pages](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/26)
- [Issue #27: Complete About page with everyone's images and credentials](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/27)

## What I did not do

- I looked into making the UI Pages a littler more professional and cleaner and also into fetching and sending request to the backend.
  I have yet to implement this.

## What Problems I encountered

- I didn't encounter too many issues with the project itself to be honest. I think the real struggles were communicating tasks and objectives
  with the other members of the frontend team and also being stuck with work from other classes.

## What I accomplished

Front end developement, and web development in general, is still new to me, so there is a lot to learn. I was able to complete the login and and signup pages after doing some research and learning along the way. The layout and formatting for these pages match up with index.html. I also linked all three pages together. You are able to get from one page to any other page in some way.

Lastly, I retrieved data from the input boxes and prepared for them to be sent to the back end for verification or account creation. I put the data in a struct, which will be sent to the back end. This format can be changed later if necessary. After doing more reading on fetch requests, I will implement actually sending the data.
