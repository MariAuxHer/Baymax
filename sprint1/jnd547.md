## What I did not do

## What I accomplished

Front end developement, and web development in general, is still new to me, so there is a lot to learn. I was able to complete the login and and signup pages after doing some research and learning along the way. The layout and formatting for these pages match up with index.html. I also linked all three pages together. You are able to get from one page to any other page in some way.

Lastly, I retrieved data from the input boxes and prepared for them to be sent to the back end for verification or account creation. I put the data in a struct, which will be sent to the back end. This format can be changed later if necessary. After doing more reading on fetch requests, I will implement actually sending the data.
