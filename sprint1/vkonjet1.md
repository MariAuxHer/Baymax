# Sprint 1

### What you planned to do
I planned on parsing the csv files so that they will be useful with both the back-end and ML divisions in our team

### What you did not do
I wasn't able to get to most of the csv files

### What problems you encountered
Lack of proper communication between me and the other members, I didn't know we were using more datasets than the one that was talked about at the start

### Issues you worked on
- [Take ML Course](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/1)
- [Parse Data in npidata.csv file](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/4)
- [Create a README.md file](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/5)


### Files you worked on
<<<<<<< HEAD
- back_end/back_end/Data/parse.ipynb
- back_end/back_end/Data/parse.py

- README.md

### What you accomplished
I gave the ability to parse out the npidata dataset in case it ever gets updated by running the parse.py file, the ipynb file is essentially the same thing but more of a testing version to really look into the data. Any work that needs to be changed with parse.py should be first tested in parse.ipynb.
