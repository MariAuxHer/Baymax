# Sprint 1

- Name: Maria Hernandez 
- Github: mherna21
- Group: Baymax

### What you planned to do
- [Initial fine-tuning of NHS-LLM Model](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/2)
- [Run Tutorial for Text Classification](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/3)
- [Take ML course](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/1)
- [Classify doctor's information](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/6)
- Review and understand backend's code.

### What you did not do
- I have not yet fine-tuned the NHS-LLM model. 
- I wanted to advance more on the LLM model - get more accurate predictions.  

### What problems you encountered
- The existing NHS-LLM model is very lightweight, which results in innacurate predictions. 
- We need to either add more instruction-based data to our dataset or change the hyperparameters of the model
to see if we get better predictions. 

### Issues you worked on
- [Initial fine-tuning of NHS-LLM Model](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/2)
- [Run Tutorial for Text Classification](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/3)
- [Take ML course](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/1)
- [Classify doctor's information based on parsed data](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/6)

### Files you worked on
- classify_doctor_info.cpp
- Light_NHS_LLM.ipynb (run it with Jordan)
- Fixed the settings.py file in the back_end folder. 

### What you accomplished
- Get a better understanding of transformers (mainly decoders-only and encoders-only) and how to use them in our software. 
- Find a trained LLM that we will use to provide the user with preliminary advice and potential diagnoses.
- Determine the model we will use (encoder-only transformer) to classify user text input into different required medical specializations. 
- Parse and classify doctor's information.
