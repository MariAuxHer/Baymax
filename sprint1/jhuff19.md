# Sprint 1

Name: Jordan Huff
Github: jordantrh
Group: Baymax

### What you planned to do
- [Develop Working LLM Model from NHS Dataset](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/2)
- [Run Tutorial for Text Classification](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/3)
- [Take ML course](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/1)

### What you did not do
- I was hoping to be able to work on the text classification model further
- I was hoping to get the LLM to a more accurate state

### What problems you encountered
- Finding a tutorial that is comprable our use cases is very difficult
- Converting tutorials to a usable model can get very complicated
- The LLM is very light right now and can be very innacurate

### Issues you worked on
- [Develop Working LLM Model from NHS Dataset](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/2)
- [Run Tutorial for Text Classification](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/3)
- [Take ML course](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/1)

### Files you worked on
- text_classification_testing.ipynb
- Light_NHS_LLM.ipynb

### What you accomplished
- We now have a better understanding of transformers and how they will be implemented for our app
- We now have a trained LLM that we can use for responding to user input with medical information (including sources)
- We now have the basis of a model that will be able to classify user text input into different required medical specializations when we train it on different data
