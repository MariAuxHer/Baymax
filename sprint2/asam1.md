# Sprint 2

Name: Amal Sam, GitHub ID: amals610, Group: Baymax

## What I planned to do
- [Issue #27: Complete About page with everyone's images and credentials](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/27)
- [Issue #65: Fixing connection bugs between pages and styling](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/65)
- [Issue #66: Creating Conversation collapsable Panel](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/66)

## What I did not do

- Still struggling with complete functionality out how to send and receive requests with backend. Teamate was able to get a response, but had an issue
  regarding the correct tokens. 

## What Problems I encountered

- I ran into some issues trying to fix code done by my peers. I was reworking some of my files and they had implemented different things which
  I needed to go back and look over to make sure I knew where to continue from. I also had some trouble with the Panel, it kept bugging out and wouldn't stay in
  the correct spot.

## Issues I worked on
- [Issue #26: Connect About page with other UI pages](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/26)
- [Issue #65: Fixing connection bugs between pages and styling](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/65)
- [Issue #66: Creating Conversation collapsable Panel](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/66)

## Files I worked on

- Baymax/front_end/about.html
- Baymax/front_end/index.html (partially)
- Baymax/front_end/CSS/about.css
- Baymax/front_end/CSS/main.css (partially)
- Baymax/front_end/JS/about.js
- Baymax/front_end/textarea_replacement.js (partially)
- Baymax/front_end/CSS/profile.css (partially)

## What I accomplished
- This Sprint I was able to finish up the about page and any other bugs that was found with it(such as button issues/redirecting to other pages).
  There were also some other issues in some of my peers code that messed up the presentation of the website and I was able to fix that. I was able to implement
  the collapsable panel where past conversation and the new conversation button will be held. I wil implementing the complete functionality for it in the upcoming 
  sprint. Overall front-end presentation is coming along great just ned to move focus to implementing connection between back and front-end.
