## What I accomplished

So for this Sprint I was able to create a page to showcase all the developers on this page. I also did some debugging for my peer's pages. Front_end work is still new to me, but I am finding it pretty fun. I only need some images for the about page and buttons redirecting it back to the main page. Overall I think we made good progress for the first sprint. In the upcoming weeks my peers and I will do more research on the various ways to fetch and request so that we can implement that into the front_end of our project.
