# Sprint 2

Name: Amal Sam, GitHub ID: amals610, Group: Baymax

## What I planned to do
- [Issue #26: Connect About page with other UI pages](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/26)
- [Issue #27: Complete About page with everyone's images and credentials](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/27)

## What I did not do

- Still struggling with complete functionality out how to send and receive requests with backend. Teamate was able to get a response, but had an issue
  regarding the correct tokens. 

## What Problems I encountered

- I ran into some issues trying to fix code done by my peers. I was reworking some of my files and they had implemented different things which
  I needed to go back and look over to make sure I knew where to continue from.

## What I accomplished

So for this Sprint I was able to create a page to showcase all the developers on this page. I also did some debugging for my peer's pages. Front_end work is still new to me, but I am finding it pretty fun. I only need some images for the about page and buttons redirecting it back to the main page. Overall I think we made good progress for the first sprint. In the upcoming weeks my peers and I will do more research on the various ways to fetch and request so that we can implement that into the front_end of our project.
