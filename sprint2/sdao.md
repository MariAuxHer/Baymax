### What you planned to do
Figure out how to send signals from the front to the back end, making sure to adhere to the security protocol.
Add the ability to delete data from the front end.

### What you did not do
Actually implement the communication into the front end. (not my designated role)
I only figured out how to do it in Javascript and made a reference for how the protocol should look like on the front end.

### What problems you encountered
I needed a deeper understanding of CSRF protection and how Django implemented it.
