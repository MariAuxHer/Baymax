# Sprint 2

Name: Jonathan Tran, GitHub ID: Elite Jono, Group: Baymax

## What I planned to do

- [Issue #16: Make a fetch request and send login/signup info to backend](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/16)
- [Issue #20: Post](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/20)
- [Issue #21: Get](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/21)
- [Issue #44: Cookies](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/44)
- [Issue #46: Make a profile page to display user info, like email and location preferences](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/46)

## What I did not do

- I was not able to get the right tokens and cookies from the back end

## What Problems I encountered

- I was busy with other work, but I also had a lot of tech issues. I struggles with getting Docker working correctly
due to problems with WSL, so testing became an issue.

## Issues I worked on

- [Issue #16: Make a fetch request and send login/signup info to backend](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/16)
- [Issue #20: Post](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/20)
- [Issue #21: Get](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/21)
- [Issue #44: Cookies](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/44)
- [Issue #46: Make a profile page to display user info, like email and location preferences](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/46)

## Files I worked on

- Baymax/front_end/index.html (partially)
- Baymax/front_end/profile.html
- Baymax/front_end/CSS/profile.css
- Baymax/front_end/JS/login.js
- Baymax/front_end/JS/textarea_replacement.js (partially)

## What I accomplished

This is all still a learning process for me, but I am making progress. I made a profile page that will be used to display user
info, such as email and location preferences. I was able to successfully make a fetch request to the backend and received a response.
However, I was not able to obtain the right tokens and cookies from the response.
