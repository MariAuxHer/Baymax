### What you planned to do
Organize the data of taxonomy values and their description to the specific doctors that they relate to
and create a dictionary in which we can use for the ML model related to finding specific doctors


### What you did not do
I have yet to implement the dictionary using an algorithm(have not chosen which one yet but probably DFS) to  add all of the doctors 
in the dictionary into the dataset useful in backend operations

### What problems you encountered
Understanding the connections between each of the files and how to actually a useful dictionary with all the information given

### Issues you worked on
- https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/40
- https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/42
- https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/43

### Files you worked on
- ML/Data/parse.py
- ML/Data/parsed_npidata.csv
- ML/Data/classify.py
- ML/Data/classify.ipynb
- ML/Data/doctor_dict.json

### What you accomplished
I pretty much accomplished what I needed to in "What you planned to do".
