# Sprint 2
- Name: Jordan Huff
- Github: jordantrh
- Group: Baymax

### What you planned to do
- [Begin Training Updated LLM](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/53)
- [Find Solution for Dataset Generation](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/54)
- [Find Solution for Prompt Generation](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/55)

### What you did not do
- I was hoping to be able to work on the text classification model further
- I was hoping to find a way to reduce the training time for the LLM. It is currently going to take somewhere between 90 and 200 hours.

### What problems you encountered
- Finding further tutorials that are comprable our use cases is very difficult
- The LLM is very time-consuming to train, and we may have to use OpenAI worst case scenario
- The dataset generation tool may be difficult to port to a text classification scenario

### Issues you worked on
- [Begin Training Updated LLM](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/53)
- [Find Solution for Dataset Generation](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/54)
- [Find Solution for Prompt Generation](https://github.com/MariAuxHer/Baymax/issues/55)

### Files you worked on
- example_train_config.yaml
- Dataset Generation.ipynb
- Prompt Creation.ipynb

### What you accomplished
- We have a good way to generate new data for the LLM and potentially the text classification model
- We have a far more accurate LLM that is currently being trained, which we will be able to integrate into the backend
